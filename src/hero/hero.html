    Creating ScrollTriggers out of order If you have any ScrollTriggers that pin
    elements (with the default pinSpacing: true) then the order in which the
    ScrollTriggers are created is important. This is because any ScrollTriggers
    after the ScrollTrigger with pinning need to compensate for the extra
    distance that the pinning adds. You can see an example of how this sort of
    thing might happen in the pen below. Notice that the third box's animation
    runs before it's actually in the viewport.

    Notice that we want the animation to start mid-screen, but when scrolling
    backwards we want it to reset at a completely different place (when the
    element goes offscreen). The solution is to use two ScrollTriggers - one for
    the playing and one for the resetting once the element is off screen.
